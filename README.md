- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeKatanaa, a beginner coder sharpening my skills one line at a time!
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the magic of programming, from simple scripts to eventually building something cool.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming (and realizing how much I didn’t know about semicolons!), and the basics of coding, and figuring out how “it works on my machine” isn’t always a good excuse.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me here on GitHub, or send a message by email (maaz201503@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I thought “Hello World” was the hardest thing ever... until I met my first bug!
-💡 Random discovery: I once tried to “fix” my code by turning my computer off and on again. Surprisingly, it didn’t work...
